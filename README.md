# E-commerce-Data-Warehouse-Dashboard-
The E-commerce Data Warehouse Dashboard uses SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, showing real-time sales, customer trends, and product performance to improve business decisions and marketing strategies.
Step 1 — Define business goals & KPIs

Goal: pick the questions the dashboard must answer.
Tools / method: workshop with stakeholders; write KPIs in a doc.
Typical KPIs: Daily Revenue, Orders, AOV, Conversion Rate, Refund Rate, Repeat Customer Rate, Top SKUs, Inventory Days.
Step 2 — Inventory sources & access

Goal: list every data source and cadence.
Tools: MySQL/Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake, CSVs, Google Analytics/GA4, Shopify/Stripe APIs, S3.
Method: create a data inventory table: source, table, owner, update_frequency, pk.
Example query (pulling raw orders from Postgres):

SELECT * FROM staging.orders_raw WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01';

Step 3 — Design star schema (dimensions + fact)

Goal: simple star model for fast analytics.
Tool/method: paper/sketch → ERD tool (dbdiagram, draw.io).
Core objects: fact_sales (grain = order_line), dim_date, dim_customer, dim_product, dim_channel.
Example DDL (simplified):

CREATE TABLE dim_product (
  product_key   BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id    TEXT UNIQUE,
  name          TEXT,
  category      TEXT,
  current_price NUMERIC,
  start_date    DATE,
  end_date      DATE,
  is_current    BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
  sale_id       BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id      TEXT,
  order_date    DATE,
  product_key   BIGINT REFERENCES dim_product(product_key),
  customer_key  BIGINT REFERENCES dim_customer(customer_key),
  qty           INTEGER,
  unit_price    NUMERIC,
  revenue       NUMERIC
);

Step 4 — Create staging & choose EL(T) pattern

Goal: safely land raw data before transforming.
Tools: Airbyte / Fivetran (ingest), S3 + Snowflake, or direct DB loads. Use staging schema for raw tables.
Method: ELT preferred: load raw then transform in warehouse (dbt recommended).
Example CTAS (staging → transformed):

CREATE TABLE warehouse.stg_orders AS
SELECT * FROM raw.orders_raw;

Step 5 — Transformations, SCD, and keys (use dbt)

Goal: cleanse, dedupe, generate surrogate keys, handle history.
Tools: dbt for modular SQL transforms; Airflow or Prefect for orchestration.
SCD Type-2 pattern (simplified):

-- deactivate old
UPDATE dim_customer
SET is_current = FALSE, end_date = now()
WHERE customer_id = :id AND is_current = TRUE;

-- insert new version
INSERT INTO dim_customer (customer_id, name, start_date, is_current)
VALUES (:id, :name, now(), TRUE);


dbt benefit: tests, lineage, version control.

Step 6 — Load fact table with lookups to dims

Goal: populate fact_sales using dims’ surrogate keys.
Method: join transformed staging to current dimension keys at load time.
Example insert:

INSERT INTO fact_sales (order_id, order_date, product_key, customer_key, qty, unit_price, revenue)
SELECT s.order_id, s.order_date,
       p.product_key, c.customer_key,
       s.qty, s.unit_price, s.qty * s.unit_price
FROM stg_orders s
JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id AND p.is_current = TRUE
JOIN dim_customer c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id AND c.is_current = TRUE;

Step 7 — Pre-aggregations & performance (materialized views)

Goal: speed up heavy analytics queries and Power BI visuals.
Tools: materialized views, summary tables, partitioning, indexes.
Example materialized view (daily sales):

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_daily_sales AS
SELECT order_date::date AS sale_date, product_key, SUM(revenue) AS daily_revenue
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY order_date::date, product_key;
-- schedule REFRESH (db-specific)


Method: refresh nightly or incremental refresh based on needs.

Step 8 — Connect Power BI (Import vs DirectQuery)

Goal: choose connection mode and import model.
Tools: Power BI Desktop, On-Prem Gateway (if private DB).
Guidance:

Import: faster visuals, use incremental refresh for large data.

DirectQuery: live data, but can be slower and has DAX limitations.
Power BI actions: Get Data → choose database → select tables (dims + fact/materialized views) → load.

Step 9 — Modeling in Power BI & DAX measures

Goal: set relationships, mark date table, create measures.
Modeling tips: keep star schema, single-directional relationships, mark dim_date as Date table.
Essential DAX measures:

Total Sales = SUM('fact_sales'[revenue])

Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_sales'[order_id])

AOV = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])


UX tips: KPI cards, time series, top products table, funnel visual (sessions→adds→orders), slicers for date/channel, drillthrough.

Step 10 — Security, scheduling, QA, and monitoring

Goal: make dashboard reliable, secure, and maintainable.
Security: Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI using role filters, and DB access control.
Example RLS DAX rule: (for sales rep)
